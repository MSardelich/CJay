CJay -- Java&trade; Native Interface made easy
----------------------------------------------

Seamlessly call Java classes (here the "*jay*") from C++. The ``Cjay`` C++ library abstracts the use of Java&trade; Native Interface (JNI).

``CJay`` comes with a ``Converter`` class that straightforwardly **cast** from *primitive wrapper classes* and some ``java.util`` classes to some C++ STL objects and vice versa.

The cast is performed using only **one member function call**. See, for example, ``j_cast<T>``, ``c_cast<T>``, ``c_cast_vector<T>``, ``c_cast_map<K,V>``.

Why?
----

* Although ``JNI`` is a mature library, its method caller entry points depend on the method description/signature i.e ``CallStaticVoidMethod``, ``CallVoidMethod``, ``CallObjectMethod``, and many others.
  On the other hand, ``CJay`` has **only one call method** (``CJ::call<T>``) for all types of description/signature.
* ``CJay`` obtains [reflective information] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) about Java classes and objects at **run-time**. It automatically disassembly Java classes and extract method names and descriptors. **Forget about all messing descriptor strings!**
* ``CJay`` comes with a **conversion class** (``Convert``) that straightforwardly **cast types** from C++ to Java and **vice versa**. The conversion class can, for exmaple, convert from Java ``Arraylist<T>`` to C++ ``Vector<T>``. See ``CJ::c_cast_vector<T>`` and ``CJ::c_cast<T>`` for general primitive types.
* Transparent interface **method caching**. Register your Java methods only once, use them around the code.
* You can still **use** functions in ``jni.h``. Just get the Java&trade; Virtual Machine enviroment pointer: ``VM::env``.
* Only **one header file**: ``CJay.hpp``
* **Exception handler** with clear and informative error messages.

Life Made Easy!
----------------

For illustration purposes, suppose you have the following ``Example.java`` class, which you want to call from your C++ code:

```java
package example;
import java.util.*;

public class Example {
  
  // Construtor
  public Example() { }
  
  // ArrayList<Integer> method
  static ArrayList<Integer> parseArrayListInteger(int x, int y) {
    ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    result.add(x);
    result.add(y);
    return result;
  }
  
  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) { }
  
}
```

The code below shows a typical C++ ``Cjay`` library implementation:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "CJay.hpp"

using namespace VM;

// Define your JDK version
jint CJ::JNI_VERSION = JNI_VERSION_1_8; 

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Instantiate CJay
    CJ CJ;
    
    // Create JVM
    std::vector<std::string> paramVM{"-ea", "-Xdebug"};
    createVM(paramVM);
    
    // Set Java class
    CJ.setClass("example/Example");
    
    // Call Java class constructor
    CJ.Constructor("<init>"); // Constructors have <init> signature
    
    // Instantiate a converter
    // It allows to cast from Java Virtual Machine to C++ and vice versa
    Converter cnv;
    
    // Main Routine:
    // 1) Cast from C++ to Java types
    // 2) Call Java method (with variables just cast)
    // 3) Cast back from Java to C++
    // Important:
    // The "call" member function is templated based on
    // the return value of Java method
    //
    // -- Java Method (ArrayList<Integer>)
    //
    
    // cast FROM C++ "int" TO Java "int"
    jint arg_i_1 = (jint) 123;
    jint arg_i_2 = (jint) 456;
    
    // call Java method
    L = CJ.call<jobject>( "parseArrayListInteger", arg_i_1, arg_i_2 ); 
    
    // cast FROM Java "ArrayList<Integer>" TO "vector<long>"
    // the caster works like magic. ONE LINE OF CODE!
    std::vector<jint> v = cnv.c_cast_vector<jint>(L); 
    
    // Destroy JVM
    destroyVM();
}    
```

General Implementation Steps
----------------------------

A standard implementation should follow the steps below.

* Add the path to Java class you want to instantiate to your ``CLASSPATH`` system enviroment variable.
* Include library **header file**: ``CJay.hpp``.
* **Assign ``JNI_VERSION``** static variable (it must be compatible with the versions described in your ``<jni.h>``).
* **Set** the Java **class**.
* **Call** Java class **constructor** (if you would call non-static methods).
* **Call** Java **method**.
  
  *Here another example...*
  
  Consider we have a Java method ``parseString`` that recieves type ``java.lang.String`` and returns ``java.lang.String``.
  
  **IMPORATNT:** *See we only have one ``call<T>`` entry point, regardless the method descriptor. It is a variadic member. The member function ``call<T>`` is temaplated based on the method return type.*
  
  ```cpp
  // cast FROM C++ "string" TO Java "java.lang.String"
  jstring arg = cnv.j_cast<jstring>("foo");
  // call Java method
  jobject L = CJ.call<jobject>( "parseString", cnv.j_cast<jstring>("foo") ); 
  // cast FROM "java.lang.String" TO C++ "string"
  std::string str = cnv.c_cast<std::string>(L);
  ```

* **Destroy** JVM when you are done

Compiler, Linker and System Variables
-------------------------------------

First of all, you need to install [Oracle Java&trade; Development Kit (JDK)] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=ocomen>).

Make sure compiler toolchain includes (-I option) your [Java&trade; Development Kit (JDK)] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=ocomen>) ``include`` sub-folder . On window you MUST include ``include\win32`` sub-folder too.

You must link (-L option) ``jvm`` file in [Java&trade; Development Kit (JDK)] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=ocomen>) ``lib`` folder, and set the system ``path`` to this folder.

``CJay`` is **C++11** compatible, so add ``-std=c++11`` flag to compiler.

**Make sure your `CLASSPATH` system enviroment variable includes path to your local copy of ``java/bin`` repository folder and to java class you want to call from C++.**

``CJay`` library was extensevely tested with the configuration: ``g++ (GCC) 4.8.1`` and `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.8`

Unit tests
----------

The `java/bin` folder has sub-folder `example` with the class library `Example.class`. Its source code can be found in `java/src` folder.

The source code exaustevely covers many methods with different signatures. Maybe it is the best way to review the seamless integration of ``CJay`` C++ library.

Compile and run ``unittest.cpp``.

Important Note
--------------

You can always check the signatures obtained from your java class by calling member ``printSignatures``.

When Java methods are overloaded they have the same ``name`` with different ``signatures``. In this case, we still have to uniquelly associate a ``key`` to overloaded method, since member ``call<T>`` receives method name.

By convention we decided to add the ``_`` symbol at end of method name together with a number, for each overloaded method.

For example, consider we have a Java class with 2 constructors:

```java
class X {
  X(Object o) { this.o = o} // constructor receives java.lang.Object
  X(int i) { this.i = i} // constructor receives primitive int
  ... 
}   
```

**ONLY IN THE OVERLOADED METHODS CASE**, you have to get unique method ``key`` using member ``getUniqueKey`` and passing the ``name`` and ``descriptor`` of method.

According to the exmaple above, you can check the key assigned to construtor that receives ``java.lang.Obejct`` using the code below:

```cpp
// Output key of constructor that receives java.lang.Object
std::cout << CJ.getUniqueKey("<init>", "(Ljava/lang/Object;)V") << std::endl;   
```

The above line of code is exepect to output ``<init>_1`` or ``<init>_2``.

In order to **call the expected overloaded method at run-time** you shoud code something like this:

```cpp
// Call constructor that receives int
CJ.call<void>(CJ.getUniqueKey("<init>", "(I)V"));
...
```

TODO
----

* ~~Improve ``Converter`` class, including, for example, a caster from ``java.util.Map<T>`` to C++ ``Map<T>``~~
* Add methods to main ``CJ`` class in order to acess Java class *fields*.
* Write documentation.
